# audiomood

## overview

A basic app that allows to play music according to the chosen mood.

 A user is presented with the player and dynamically created buttons with different moods. When a particular mood is chosen the first 7 tracks corresponding to that mood will be listed in the player with the displayed genre. The auto play is not on, therefore in order to play the track it has to be selected first.
